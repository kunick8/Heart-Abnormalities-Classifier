# Heart imagery abnormalities classifier
## Quick overhaul
This project's objective is to create a highly accurate classifier for detecting abnormalities in heart imagery
from patterns created from Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. 


## Dataset
Dataset comes from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/96/spectf+heart, It contains 267 instances grouped into two categories: normal and abnormal.
The data consists of 44 independent, continuous variables ranging from 0 to 100 and a binary variable representing abnormality, where 0 = normal and 1 = abnormal.
There wasn't any missing data and files could be interpreted as csv's. The data had been originally split into 187 test instances and 80 train instances,
yet I've decided to use a train/test split of 70/30 to achieve a more accurately trained model. To offset this difference in the test set I've decided to use the
K- fold cross validation algorithm which will use small folds of training data to test the model
before passing it for tests with test data.
